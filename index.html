                    It is a boardind school and it is said that schools shape us to become more responsible adults. We must treat our schools with respect as they are the places of worship for a student. A good student is the product of a good school. My school has excellent teachers who help students with studies, sports, and other extracurricular activities. They are the building blocks of aa school and teach us important lessons that we must apply in our daily lives.  Schools teach us to cooperate with our friends and classmates. The basic value of sharing is taught right from the beginning. We have different classrooms where the teachers teach us different subjects. Equal weightage is given to both studies and co-curricular activities so that we develop into better individuals. Our schools will always try to focus on our overall growth and transform us into healthy adults.
